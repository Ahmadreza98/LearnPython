---
#### 1. Greater than `>`
```
1 > 2 -> res: False: F
2 > 1 -> res: True: T
```
#### 2. Equal or Greater than `>=`
```
1 >= 2 -> res: F
2 >= 2 -> res: T
```
#### 3. lower than `<`
```
1 < 2 -> res: T
2 < 1 -> res: F
```
#### 4. Equal or lower than `<=`
```
1 <= 2 -> res: T
2 <= 2 -> res: T
```
#### 5. Equal `==`
```
'Ali' == 'ali' -> res: F
'Ali' == 'Ali' -> res: T
1 == 2 -> res: F
2 == 2 -> res: T
```
#### 6. Not equal `!=`
```
1 != 2 -> res: T
2 != 2 -> res: F
```
