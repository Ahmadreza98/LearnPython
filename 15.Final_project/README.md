## TODO LIST Project

---
In this project, you will create a To-Do List manager that uses various 
Python concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), reading and 
writing CSV files, and data management. The project includes the ability to 
add, delete, and view tasks, as well as save and load to-do lists from a file.

### Project features
- Add new task: A new task is added to the list.
- Delete task: The task is removed from the list.
- View task list: All tasks in the list are displayed.
- Save task list to CSV file: All tasks are automatically saved to a CSV file.
- Load from CSV file: The task list is automatically loaded from a CSV file.
- Select priority for tasks: Each task can have a priority (e.g. high, medium 
or low).

### Project details
